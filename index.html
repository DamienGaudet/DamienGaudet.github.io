<p>
Pixel art isn’t just art made of pixels —  it’s art that evokes the look of early computer and video game imagery. That includes everything from Pong to Sonic the Hedgehog.
</p>
<p>
Early video games were lower resolution — it was impossible to hide the tiny rectangles that created the worlds of Space Invaders and Donkey Kong — so pixel art arose out of necessity. The artists making video games in the 1970s and 1980s had to innovate and boil images down to their essence. A few red pixels would have to suggest Mario’s hat, and one or two pixels would have to be understood as his hands or face.
</p>
<p>
In the 16-bit era of the 1990s, pixel art became more detailed but the spirit remained the same. Artists had a bigger canvas to work with, but they were still working with individual pixels — each of which played an important role in creating the overall image.
